Subject: [PATCH 1/3] expose 64-bit sequence numbers for XLib

While XCB uses 64-bit sequence number internally, it only exposes
"unsigned int" so that, on 32-bit architecture, Xlib based applications
may see their sequence number wrap which causes the connection to the X
server to be lost.

Expose 64-bit sequence number from XCB API so that Xlib and others can
use it even on 32-bit environment.

This implies the following API addition:

  xcb_send_request64()
  xcb_discard_reply64()
  xcb_wait_for_reply64()
  xcb_poll_for_reply64()
